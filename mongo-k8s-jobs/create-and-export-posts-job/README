This folder contains a Kubernetes Job that creates post via an API and exports all the posts to a CSV file.

## Overview

Since I worked on a Windows machine using Docker Desktop, I encountered issues with mounting volumes between the host and the container.
Therefore, I ran the job using the current YAML file **without** volume mounts, keeping the container running for 5 minutes to manually copy the CSV file.

I was using this command:
kubectl cp blog-namespace/<pod_name>:/app/post.csv ./post.csv

-----------------------
On a Linux machine, you can directly mount the volume to your host to automatically export the CSV file outside the container.
Iâ€™ve provided an example YAML file in the yaml-file-with-volumes folder.

You can edit the hostPath in that file to point to a directory on your machine where you'd like the CSV to be exported.
-----------------------

Note: The post.csv file already present in this directory is an example that I exported during my testing.
