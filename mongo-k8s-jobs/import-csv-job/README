This Kubernetes job is designed to import a CSV file containing posts into a MongoDB instance within a Kubernetes cluster.

Files Overview:
posts.csv: Contains sample post data sourced from the MongoDB training website.
import-csv-job.py: Python script that reads the CSV and imports the posts into MongoDB.
Dockerfile: Used to create a container image for running the import job.
import-csv-job.yaml: Kubernetes YAML file to deploy the job.

Explanation:
The task required importing a MongoDB db dump using the link provided in the assignment. However, the dump was unavailable, so I manually created a posts.csv file based on an example collection of posts found on the MongoDB training website. The import job uses this CSV file instead of the database dump.

The job reads the posts.csv file and imports its contents into the MongoDB database running in the Kubernetes cluster.
