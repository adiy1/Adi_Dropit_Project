Kubernetes Setup
I included here two setup scripts to deploy a Kubernetes environment for running the app:

setup.ps1 for Windows (PowerShell)
setup.sh for Linux (Bash)
Simply choose the appropriate script for your operating system to deploy the environment.

Note:
Make sure to update any necessary file paths within the scripts to match your directory structure before running them.
